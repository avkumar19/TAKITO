# TALKITO

This is a project based on Machine Learning,Arduino and some electronics.I have designed on glove(Data glove) that can convert gestures into speech. This is the first Prototype with few basics hardware support.

## Getting Started
The Project contains two Matlab Scripts and one arduino code for data transfer. 



### Prerequisites

For runnig the Code you need to have matlab installed into your system and you need to be aware of matlab commands.For trainnig your own data you need to have your own data glove. 


### Setup

Connect your glove using aruino to your Laptop.
#### Now you need to run sketch_jun15a.ino on arduino.
#### For data transfer from aruino to Excel I have used Aduino Excel 2.1. link(http://www.robertovalgolio.com/sistemi-programmi/arduino-excel/arduino-excel-download).
#### Now you have created your own dataset train. Just run the script "trainClassifier.m " using correct parameters on the dataset.(You will get to know about this after reading the code)
#### Once you have trained your data using the code, just Run "Readanalog.m" after providing test data.You will start hearing some voice as you have trained.
### WOW! you have justed created and awesome tool.
